[**Project -1 - Fatal Collisions - Python**](https://github.com/Hitesh150497/Fatal_collisions_MachineLearning_python)

•	Predicted the rates of Fatal collisions with the reference of past 10 years Fatal and Non-Fatal collisions dataset using machine learning algorithms in Python (NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-Learn). Carefully, looked at the contribution of different variables.
•	Scaled and transformed 40% of data to improve the data processing and data quality.
•	Applied feature engineering and statistical analysis to remove around 35% irrelevant and unnecessary variables.
•	Found insights using exploratory data analysis, visualization, and data modeling (Linear/Logistic Regression) and then proposed solutions to the clients.
•	Created different visuals to support the stories and then presented the most impactful 10 variables to clients for improvements.

[**Project -2 - Loan-dataset - Tableau**](https://github.com/Hitesh150497/Tableau_loan_dataset)

•	The given dataset has different variables to recognize the patterns between the people who are paying/not paying their loans in time.
•	The user-centric data has lots of demographic information like gender, marital status.
•	The social-educational variables like literacy level, occupation
•	Loan and financial related variables help in purpose of loan, application score, installment amount, balance amount, disbursed amount, arrears amount.
•	Branch ID talks about the customers of specific geography.
•	The attached presentation will help understand the story related to data and analytical file to go through the raw data, and tableau file to see in tableau.


[**Project -3 - R Assignment**](https://github.com/Hitesh150497/RAssignment)
In this assessment, I did some basic operations on data using R.

•	Producing the structure of data, listing the variables, print top rows.
•	Wrote a user-defined function.
•	Performed data manipulation by filtering, and putting conditions, removing missing values, handled duplicate variables.
•	Arranged data by reordering and renaming the variables.
•	Found the dependent and independent variables within the dataset.
•	Performed mathematical and statistical operations.
•	Plotted scatterplots and bar plots and found a correlation between variables.
•	At last, extracted the RMD file into PDF format.
•	CSV file contains cereals dataset, pdf file shows all the coding and comments lines with appropriate and distinctive colors, and RMD file can be run in R studio directly.
