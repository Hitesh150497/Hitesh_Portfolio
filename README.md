[**Project -1 - Fatal Collisions**](https://github.com/Hitesh150497/Fatal_collisions_MachineLearning_python)

•	Predicted the rates of Fatal collisions with the reference of past 10 years Fatal and Non-Fatal collisions dataset using machine learning algorithms in Python (NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-Learn). Carefully, looked at the contribution of different variables.
•	Scaled and transformed 40% of data to improve the data processing and data quality.
•	Applied feature engineering and statistical analysis to remove around 35% irrelevant and unnecessary variables.
•	Found insights using exploratory data analysis, visualization, and data modeling (Linear/Logistic Regression) and then proposed solutions to the clients.
•	Created different visuals to support the stories and then presented the most impactful 10 variables to clients for improvements.
